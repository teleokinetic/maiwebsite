# Tanner

## Basic Info
- **Start Date:** 2025-01-10
- **Bodyweight:** 150lb
- **Session Frequency (with trainer):** Self-coached
- **Weekly Session Frequency:** 2 formal strength sessions
- **Session Type:** Self-directed
- **Primary Goals:** 
  - Muscle-up (solid, no momentum)
  - Freestanding HSPU (or wall HSPU progression toward free)
  - Back squat: 225lb for 3x5 (1.5x BW)
- **Secondary Goals:**
  - Horizontal archer row 3x8
  - DB row benchmark (TBD — find equivalent to archer row strength)
  - Nordic curl progression (slow due to ACL)
- **Long-term Vision:** Narrow to 1x/week maintenance routine after hitting primary goals. Wants most time available for other activity.

## History & Constraints
- **Injury History:** 
  - ACL graft ~2 years ago → stay at hamstring slides and hip-hinge-vertical-thighs before any eccentric lowering
- **Movement Background:** 
  - Years of training experience
  - Currently out of strength training rhythm
  - Very active otherwise (movement practice, other training modalities)
- **Equipment Access:** Rings, barbell, dumbbells, bar for pullups
- **Time/Energy Constraints:** 
  - 2x/week at high intensity feels tough
  - Honesty about sustainability is important

## Current Baselines
- **Wall HSPU:** 3x6
- **Back Squat:** 3x5 @ 185lb, 1-2 RIR
- **Pullup:** Rebuilding — current max TBD
- **Dip:** Rebuilding — current max TBD
- **Nordic:** Early progression (hamstring slides, hip hinge vertical thighs only for now)

## Definite Inclusions
- KOT calf raise 3x5-8 (tight soleus theory)

## Preferences & Notes
- **Responds Well To:** Systematic progressions, clear benchmarks, efficiency
- **Avoid:** Overcommitting volume/intensity that won't be sustainable
- **Communication Style:** Direct, self-aware, willing to adjust based on reality

## Trainer Notes

### 2025-01-10
- Initial context capture
- Currently rebuilding pulling/pushing capacity
- No muscle-up transitions attempted yet
- 2x/week formal strength is the ceiling right now
- Other activity is high — strength work should be efficient, not exhausting
- Back squat target: 225lb (1.5x BW) — but consider building reps at 185 first to manage intensity
- Nordic: stay conservative, slides and hip hinge only until confidence builds
