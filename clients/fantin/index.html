      <!-- Why This Matters -->
      <section id="why-this-matters" class="course-section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Why This Matters</h2>
        <div class="intro-text">
          <p>Your experience is made of three things: thoughts, feelings, and actions. You're already precise with thoughts. This mini-course builds precision with feelings. Specifically, the ability to sense emotions as physical textures in your body.</p>
          <p>The aim here is not to become more emotional, but to increase the resolution of what is already there. Higher resolution means:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Earlier signal detection.</strong> You notice what's happening before it drives behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>More choicefulness.</strong> You can respond rather than react.</li>
            <li><strong>Better data for habit change.</strong> Feelings can help maintain habits. If they are not sensed clearly, they may be maintaining habits without you realizing it.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Increasing your ability to discriminate emotional textures can change the pain experience. This is distinct from "thinking positive." Thinking positively can be helpful, but this approach aims to give your nervous system better information.</p>
          <p>For example: a client might feel "my back hurts" as one undifferentiated block. With more interoceptive resolution, they start to notice that part of what they're calling "pain" is actually frustration about the pain, or anxiety about it getting worse, or bracing against anticipated movement. These emotional textures have been fused with the nociceptive signal. When they can discriminate&mdash;"this part is the physical sensation, this part is my frustration about it"&mdash;the whole experience can shift, sometimes dramatically.</p>

      <!-- The Five Skills -->
      <section id="five-skills" class="course-section">
        <h2 class="section-title">The Five Skills</h2>
        <p>These skills work together. You'll practice all of them from day one, starting simple and adding complexity.</p>

        <ul class="skills-list">
          <li>
            <span class="skill-name">1. Noticing</span>
            <p class="skill-question">The question: Is something happening in my body right now?</p>
            <p><strong>Basic unit:</strong> Binary detection. Yes, there's something. Or no, I can't find anything.</p>
            <p><strong>What it's like when it's working:</strong> You become aware of a sensation you weren't aware of a moment ago. It's like noticing the song playing in the background at a cafe. It was always there, but now you've noticed it.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="skill-name">2. Locating</span>
            <p class="skill-question">The question: Where in my body is this?</p>
            <p><strong>Basic unit:</strong> Pointing to a general region (head, throat, chest, belly, limbs) without needing to be exact.</p>
            <p><strong>What it's like when it's working:</strong> You can gesture toward the area. "It's somewhere around here." Precision comes later.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="skill-name">3. Describing</span>
            <p class="skill-question">The question: What is this like?</p>
            <p><strong>Basic unit:</strong> One quality-word that captures something true about it. (Tight, loose, warm, cool, heavy, light, buzzy, still, sharp, dull, hollow, full...)</p>
            <p><strong>What it's like when it's working:</strong> The word comes from the sensation, not from your analysis. It might surprise you.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="skill-name">4. Resonance-Checking</span>
            <p class="skill-question">The question: Does this description fit?</p>
            <p><strong>Basic unit:</strong> Sensing whether a word feels "closer" or "further" from the sensation. Not right/wrong, but closer/further.</p>
            <p><strong>What it's like when it's working:</strong> There's a subtle "click" or "yes" feeling when description matches sensation. Or a "not quite" feeling when it doesn't. This is a felt sense, not a logical judgment.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="skill-name">5. Tracking</span>
            <p class="skill-question">The question: Is this changing?</p>
            <p><strong>Basic unit:</strong> Noticing after 30-60 seconds whether the sensation is the same, different, gone, or shifted.</p>
            <p><strong>What it's like when it's working:</strong> You catch a sensation mid-shift. You notice it getting stronger, softer, or moving.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Note: these skills are not distinct. They overlap and inform each other. But, practicing them as distinct "moves" can help clarify what aspect of emotional interoception would be most helpful to practice.</em></p>

              </li>
              <li>The goal isn't to find the perfect word. It's to feel the difference between closer and further. Say each word out loud and check.</li>
              <li>Notice: What happens in your body when a word gets close? Is there a release, a recognition, a settling?</li>
              <li>Notice: What happens when a word is off? A tightening, a blankness, a "no"?</li>
              <li>Try describing one sensation with three different words that all partially fit. Can you feel the slightly different "fit quality" of each?</li>

        <h2 class="section-title">Scaffolding Reference</h2>
        <p>Keep this list for when you get stuck at any stage:</p>

        <h3>If you can't NOTICE (nothing is there):</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Do light exercise first (jumping jacks, shake out)</li>
          <li>Check for physical sensation as a gateway (temperature, pressure, heartbeat)</li>
          <li>"Turn up the volume" on the emotion source, make the memory more extreme</li>
          <li>Notice the quality of blankness itself: is it numb, empty, foggy, calm?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>If you can't LOCATE (it's "everywhere" or "nowhere"):</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Place a hand on different body regions and check each</li>
          <li>Start with the big three: head, chest, belly. Which has more of something?</li>
          <li>Use posture: let body take a shape, then feel where the posture is most alive</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>If you can't DESCRIBE (words don't come or don't fit):</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the basic list: tight, loose, warm, cool, heavy, light, buzzy, still, sharp, dull</li>
          <li>Just pick the "least wrong" word, precision comes later</li>
          <li>Try images instead: What color? What texture? What object?</li>
          <li>Try sounds: If this sensation made a noise, what would it be?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>If you can't CHECK RESONANCE (all words feel the same):</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Try obviously wrong words first to feel the "no" signal</li>
          <li>Slow down&mdash;resonance is subtle and takes a second to register</li>
          <li>Place attention in the body region before checking, not in your head</li>
          <li>Check with images or metaphors instead of words</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>If you can't TRACK (nothing seems to change):</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Stay longer&mdash;change is often slow</li>
          <li>Take a breath and notice if that changes anything</li>
          <li>Shift your body slightly (lean, sigh, stretch) and notice response</li>
          <li>Accept that stability is valid data&mdash;some sensations don't change quickly</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>General amplification techniques:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Exaggeration:</strong> Make the source stimulus more extreme</li>
          <li><strong>Posture:</strong> Let body take a shape that matches the feeling</li>
          <li><strong>Breath:</strong> Breathe into the region where sensation is located</li>
          <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Rock, sway, or gesture and notice what emerges</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This course builds the basic capacity to sense emotional texture in your body. With this foundation, you can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use emotions as data in decision-making (not just thoughts)</li>
          <li>Notice emotional patterns that maintain habits (including pain-related habits)</li>
          <li>Work with practices that require felt-sense access (Focusing, coherence therapy, somatic work)</li>
          <li>Catch emotional responses earlier, before they drive unconscious behavior</li>
        </ul>
